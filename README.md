## assignment

I want a textarea that I can paste a bunch of email address into that after clicking a button, another element will be populated with the values in the standard format: 
 
"Bob Jones" <bob@example.com> 
Bob <bob@example.com> 
bob@example.com <bob@example.com> 
 
It should work like most standard email apps handling no names, quotes, different delimiters. Anything that is invalid should be marked as so. Do not use any existing libraries. Everything should be in a single HTML file 
 
When you are ready to start, create an repro on github with an initial empty commit. When you finish, do a second commit. 

## Best effort. 

Plenty of room to move. 
So much learned. 
Regex, like an impossible
Haiku. Fuck. But, potatoes call.

Think I'm all set,
